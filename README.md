Open Science Dashboards for Biomedical Research Organisations

### Description
Our objective is to create a digital tool that can automatically curate information, thus providing an audit, about OS research practices. Specifically, we will design and implement an automated dashboard that reports OS metrics. Our tool will be developed for and specific to the discipline of biomedicine. The dashboard will display metrics and benchmarks to visualize institutional and individual performance regarding OS practices.

This repository contains version controlled SQL queries and processing scripts.
